# CFX


For years I have wanted to participate in fund initiatives to invest in projects (startups and others), but the bureaucracy, the high requirements, and many other problems make it very difficult. And it is something that not only I experience, but also many other people who have a little money and want to support projects in the medium/long term.

The exact size of the private investment fund market is difficult to determine, as there is no single, comprehensive source of data. However, it is estimated that this market has experienced significant growth in recent decades. According to Bain & Company's Global Private Equity Report 2021, assets under management in the private equity industry reached a record of approximately US$4.6 trillion in 2020. In addition to traditional private equity, there are also other types of private investment funds, such as hedge funds, venture capital funds, and private debt funds. Each of these segments has distinct characteristics and investment approaches.

Therefore, through DAO (decentralized organizations) we can create structures so that anyone can invest, through investment clubs (by affinity of ideas, professional relationship, etc.) through Blockchain from anywhere in the world and with fewer requirements. That is why CFX  was born.

## üí°Introduction

CFX  Club allows you to manage investment clubs, and to spread access to participate in investment funds to anyone, decentralized, agile, and without bureaucracy.Implementing a comprehensive on-chain governance system allows DataDAO members to create and vote on proposals, covering aspects such as member management, dataset storage and distribution, and token distribution. This ensures a democratic and transparent decision-making process within the DAO.


## Restrictions
The club smart contract has some restrictions, similar to real hedge funds:

- Up to 99 members per club (in many jurisdictions, such as the USA and Chile, this is the maximum limit of club members for certain purposes and types of clubs).
- Only members can participate in club instances.
- Only members who contribute funds to a club have the right to create proposals.
- Only proposal creators can execute them.


## The Graph 

The code for the Subgraph is in this folder: https://github.com/Omega12Pirme/CFX/tree/main/TheGraph/Frontend/treasure

The subgraph is: https://thegraph.com/studio/subgraph/treasure/playground

I created this subgraph and used for creating club  dashboard, Proposal dashboard and voting dashboard.

## üí• Challenges we ran into
- I faced issue with the accout abstraction  bundler and gas manager.
- I faced issue with the persistance of Particle network gets solved  by the particle mentor
